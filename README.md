## ðŸ“„ Overview

**RFM Analysis** is a powerful customer segmentation technique that classifies customers based on:
---
| **RFM Component** | **What it Measures**            | **Why It Is Important**                                                                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recency (R)**   | Days since the last purchase    | Helps identify how recently a customer has interacted with the business, indicating their current level of engagement. |
| **Frequency (F)** | Number of purchases              | Reveals how often a customer makes purchases, reflecting their loyalty and long-term relationship with the brand.       |
| **Monetary (M)**  | Total money spent                | Shows how much revenue a customer generates, helping identify high-value and profitable customers.                      |

By analyzing these three metrics, businesses can:
- Identify **high-value customers**
- Design **targeted marketing campaigns**
- Increase **customer retention and loyalty**
