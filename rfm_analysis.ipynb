    "This project aims to analyze transactional data from an online UK-based retail store, covering customer purchases made between December 2010 and December 2011. Our primary goal is to segment customers using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis**, allowing us to better understand customer loyalty and spending patterns. Additionally, we will explore sales trends, product performance, and customer demographics to gain deeper insights into purchasing behavior.  \n",

    "> Dominance of UK Market:\n",
    "> - The **United Kingdom** dominates the dataset with **3,916 customers** (**90% of all customers**), generating **£7.24 million** in revenue—**82% of total revenue and **90% of all transactions**. Despite the volume, the **average order value** (£437) and **revenue per customer** (£1,850) are **modest** compared to some international markets. This confirms that the business is **heavily concentrated in the domestic market**, making the UK the primary driver of business performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> High-Value International Markets:\n",
    "> - **Netherlands**, **Ireland**, and **Australia** stand out with **xceptional revenue per customer (£15K–£85K)**, suggesting **high-value bulk orders** despite **minimal customer bases**.\n",
    "> - Countries like **Germany**, **France** and **Spain** show a healthy mix of order volume and value, with revenue per customer ranging between **£1,800 and £2,100**, making them strong mid-tier performers.\n",
    "> - Netherlands, Ireland, Germany & France collectively contribute 10.6% of revenue (Netherlands alone ranks 2nd in revenue despite 0.5% of transactions).\n",
    "> - **Japan**, **Switzerland**, **Sweden** and **Lebanon** also have **fewer customers**, but very **high AOVs and revenue per customer**, suggesting **premium purchase behavior**.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "> Average order quantities vary dramatically between countries :\n",
    "> - Netherlands: 2,153 items/order (Highest volume)\n",
    "> - UK: 255 items/order (Volume-driven)\n",
    "> - Most countries: 200-600 items/order\n",
    "\n",
    "> Long Tail of Smaller Markets    \n",
    "> - 30+ countries each contribute <1% of revenue with low transaction volume. Several of these may represent **growth opportunities** for potential market expansion (e.g., Switzerland with £1,116 AOV) through strategic targeting or localized campaigns."

    "### **Customer Behaviour Insights (From EDA)**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **1. Revenue & Sales Patterns**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - Revenue peaked in **November 2011** (*likely due to holiday shopping*), with notable increases in **March**, **May**, and **September**.  \r\n",
    "  - Most transactions occur **midday (10 AM–3 PM)** and **midweek (Tue–Thu)**, accounting for ~80% of total transactions and revenue.  \r\n",
    "  - The average order value (AOV) is **£474.80**, with most purchases occurring during business hours — suggesting a predominantly **B2B customer base**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Schedule **flash sales**, **discounts**, and **“Midday Deals”** during peak weekday hours, particularly on **Thursdays**.  \r\n",
    "  - Launch **seasonal campaigns in Q4** — especially October to November — and offer **loyalty incentives** to retain new seasonal shoppers.  \r\n",
    "  - Experiment with **early morning (before 10 AM)** and **weekend promotions** to engage additional customer segments.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **2. Market Expansion Strategy**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - The **UK** drives **90% of orders** and **82% of revenue**, representing the **core market**.  \r\n",
    "  - Secondary European markets (e.g., **Netherlands**, **Ireland**, **Germany**, **France**, **Australia**) exhibit **high revenue per customer**, suggesting bulk or high-value buying.  \r\n",
    "  - Smaller countries with <1% revenue (e.g., **Sweden**, **Switzerland**, **Japan**) show potential based on **high AOVs**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Continue optimizing for the **UK**, while enhancing **personalized experiences** in high-value international markets.  \r\n",
    "  - Test **localized campaigns** and **regional offers** in emerging markets to unlock untapped growth.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **3. Product & Sales Performance**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - Top-selling products are **home décor** and **seasonal gift items** (e.g., bird crafts, cake stands, heart-shaped holders), reflecting demand for **affordable, decorative, and giftable goods**.  \r\n",
    "  - Product preferences vary by country — e.g., *art kits in Australia*, *chalk/gift packs in Austria*, *lip glosses in Bahrain*.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Maintain strong inventory levels of **high-demand items**, especially ahead of **key holidays**.  \r\n",
    "  - Expand **themed product bundles** and introduce a **“Top Picks by Country”** feature for regional targeting.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **4. Customer Loyalty & Retention**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - A **70.8% retention rate over 6 months** and **65.3% repeat buyer rate** show strong loyalty — but **34.7% of customers** purchase only once.  \r\n",
    "  - Spikes in churn (e.g., **November 2011**) coincide with seasonal acquisition, indicating **short-term buyers** often fail to convert into loyal customers.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Set up **post-holiday re-engagement flows** to convert seasonal shoppers into repeat buyers.  \r\n",
    "  - Use **targeted onboarding** and **tailored offers** for first-time customers.  \r\n",
    "  - Launch a **loyalty or rewards program** to incled in HTML for a presentation or markdown file!"

    "#### **1. Focus on High-Value Segments**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - **Champions (14%)** and **Loyal Customers (17%)** together generate over **£6.7M**, contributing nearly **80% of total revenue**.  \r\n",
    "  - **Champions (589 customers)** alone drive over **£4.4M** — more than **50% of overall revenue**.  \r\n",
    "  - These segments have **low recency**, **high frequency**, and **strong monetary value**, indicating deep brand engagement.  \r\n",

    "  - Offer **VIP treatment** to Champions through **early access**, **exclusive rewards**, and **referral bonuses**.  \r\n",
    "  - Use **personalized upselling** and **priority engagement** to deepen loyalty with top-tier customers.  \r\n",
    "  - Convert Potential Loyalists into Loyal Customers using **tailored promotions**, **loyalty programs**, and **curated bundles**, while encouraging **reviews and referrals**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **2. Recover At-Risk & Dormant High-Value Customers**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - Segments like **“Can’t Lose Them”** and **“At Risk”** have **high historical spending** but recent disengagement.  \r\n",
    "  - Despite inactivity, they still contribute over **£1M in revenue**, showing strong **recovery potential**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Launch **win-back campaigns** with **personalized emails**, **exclusive discounts**, and **time-sensitive offers**.  \r\n",
    "  - Use **VIP reactivation strategies** for “Can’t Lose Them,” and **automated re-engagement flows** for “At Risk,” showcasing **trending or previously viewed products**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **3. Nurture Promising & New Customers**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - **New** and **Promising** customers show **high recency**, but **low frequency and spending**, indicating **early-stage engagement** with potential long-term value.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Create **welcome journeys** with **onboarding guides**, **follow-up emails**, and **second-purchase incentives**.  \r\n",
    "  - Offer **personalized product suggestions** and **small loyalty rewards** to build purchase habits.  \r\n",
    "  - Encourage early enrollment in **loyalty programs** to guide Promising customers toward higher-value behaviors.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "#### **4. Optimize or Let Go of Low-ROI Segments**\r\n",
    "- **Insight:**  \r\n",
    "  - Segments like **“About to Sleep”**, **“Needs Attention”**, and **“Hibernating”** include over **1,500 customers** but contribute **minimal revenue** and show **limited engagement**.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "- **Recommendations:**  \r\n",
    "  - Use **batch marketing** approaches such as **seasonal promos** or **“We miss you” emails**.  \r\n",
    "  - Trigger **cart reminders** and **one-click reorder prompts** to re-engage low-ROI customers.  \r\n",
    "  - **Avoid high-effort outreach** — focus instead on slide, report, or GitHub `README.md` format."
