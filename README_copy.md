## 📄 Overview

**RFM Analysis** is a powerful customer segmentation technique that classifies customers based on:
---
| **RFM Component** | **What it Measures**            | **Why It Is Important**                                                                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recency (R)**   | Days since the last purchase    | Helps identify how recently a customer has interacted with the business, indicating their current level of engagement. |
| **Frequency (F)** | Number of purchases              | Reveals how often a customer makes purchases, reflecting their loyalty and long-term relationship with the brand.       |
| **Monetary (M)**  | Total money spent                | Shows how much revenue a customer generates, helping identify high-value and profitable customers.                      |

---

By analyzing these three metrics, businesses can:
- Identify **high-value customers**
- Design **targeted marketing campaigns**
- Increase **customer retention and loyalty**

## 🧠 RFM Analysis & Segmentation

RFM scores are calculated and assigned to customers using a scale of 1–5:
- **Recency**: Days since last purchase (lower = better)
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases (higher = better)
- **Monetary**: Total spend (higher = better)

### 🎯 Customer Segments

# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation – RFM Analysis

This project performs detailed customer segmentation using **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) analysis** on transactional data from a UK-based online retail store. The goal is to identify high-value customer groups, analyze purchasing behavior, and provide actionable business insights for improving customer engagement, retention, and marketing strategies.

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze customer purchasing behavior using RFM metrics.
- Segment customers based on engagement and value.
- Identify high-value, at-risk, and inactive customers.
- Recommend marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
- Visualize key patterns in sales, segments, and customer dynamics.

---

## 📊 What is RFM Analysis?

| RFM Component | What it Measures              | Why It’s Important |
|---------------|-------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Recency (R)** | How recently a customer made a purchase | Indicates engagement and likelihood of reactivation |
| **Frequency (F)** | How often a customer purchases | Reflects loyalty and purchasing consistency |
| **Monetary (M)** | How much a customer spends | Helps identify high-revenue contributors |

Each customer is scored from 1–5 for each metric, with **5 being the best**. These scores are then combined to assign customers into segments such as *Champions*, *Loyal Customers*, *At Risk*, *New Customers*, etc.
